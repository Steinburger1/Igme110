                    This picture means a lot to me personally. It is an artistic achievement, the likeness of which will never again be seen by mortal man. This picture is the beginning - and the ending - of true art. When I made this image, I knew it would be one for the ages, and it has not lost that view in my mind.

                    I am in college for video game development. I like video games. Dark Souls is cool. I like movies too. I worked at a go-kart place for a while. I also like going to the gym, but that's neither here nor there. (I can do a pull up, though.) My favorite classes relate to my major, while my least favorite classes don't.
                    <strong> I love Dark Souls.</strong>
